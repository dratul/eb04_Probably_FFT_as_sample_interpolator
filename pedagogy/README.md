#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the user  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User be able to demonstratrate samples to be interpolated | User should click on the buttons to visualize the samples and simulator will provide the required samples | Are you able to observe the samples
2.| User will be able to inspect FFT of the samples | Based on the samples submitted by the user simulator will perform fast fourier transform and provide resulting coefficients | Please answer about the type of FFT Coefficients. Are they real, imaginary or complex

<br>

Sr.No | What user will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| click on appropriate button to start simulator |  Simulator will start and show basic instructions | Make the user aware about simulator
2.| Enter the input samples of the signal | Will accept the input for perform FFT | Perform FFT on the input samples.
3.| Observe FFT of samples | Show amplitude of FFT Coefficients | Observe FFT of samples
4.| Observe interpolated signal | Show interpolated samples | Interpolation of samples
