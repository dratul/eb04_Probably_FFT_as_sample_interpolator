#### 3. Instructional Strategy
 Name of Instructional Strategy  :  Expository and  <u> Guided inquiry
 ##### Assessment Method: Formative

<u> <b>Description: </b></u>
This experiment is for the users who have understood the concepts of Fourier series, Fourier Transform and fast Fourier transform(FFT). The outcome of the experiment can be predicted by the user based on the conceptual understanding of FFT. In addition to this, user may change samples and observe the output therefore guided inquiry. Assesment will be taken formally through quiz questions.

####  4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the user  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User be able to demonstratrate samples to be interpolated | User should click on the buttons to visualize the samples and simulator will provide the required samples | Are you able to observe the samples (A) Yes (B) No
2.| User will be able to inspect FFT of the samples | Based on the samples submitted by the user simulator will perform fast fourier transform and provide resulting coefficients | Please answer about the type of FFT Coefficients. Are they (A) real, (B) imaginary or (C) complex 
3.| Experiment with concept of fast Fourier transform for interpolation of samples | Based on the FFT coefficients obtained simulator will perform interpolation and provide resulting waveform | Are you able to observe curve of interpolation (A) Yes (B) No
