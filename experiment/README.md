### Aim
To verify FFT as sample interpolator..
### Theory
In this experiment fast Fourier transform has been used for interpolation of samples. user will enter samples of the data samples observed from any other source within the specified criterion. He/she will be able to use fast Fourier transform for interpolation of data and the outputs being generated by those codes simultaneously.
Code to be used:
 
```assembly
Squarewave: CPL P1.0     # complement the components of port 1.0
            ACALL Delay  # a delay of required time is obtained
            SJMP Squarewave
```

The delay program guides us to a timer which runs for the required amount of time and once the delay program finishes, the pointer gets back and moves to the next statement which guides it to the top of the program and the cycle continues.

### Procedure
The user inputs the delay he/she wants  and sees a squarewave corresponding to that delay.If the user wants to give the frequency , then he/she must find half of the inverse of frequency.

<pre><code>DELAY = 1/(2 * FREQUENCY)
</code></pre>
