### Aim
To generate 10KHz square wave using 8051 microcontroller.
### Theory
We generate a square wave using a microcontroller. We will be able to see the input code and the outputs being generated by those codes simultaneously.
Code to be used:
 
```assembly
Squarewave: CPL P1.0     # complement the components of port 1.0
            ACALL Delay  # a delay of required time is obtained
            SJMP Squarewave
```

The delay program guides us to a timer which runs for the required amount of time and once the delay program finishes, the pointer gets back and moves to the next statement which guides it to the top of the program and the cycle continues.

### Procedure
The user inputs the delay he/she wants  and sees a squarewave corresponding to that delay.If the user wants to give the frequency , then he/she must find half of the inverse of frequency.

<pre><code>DELAY = 1/(2 * FREQUENCY)
</code></pre>
