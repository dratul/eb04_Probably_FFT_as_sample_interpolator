### Aim
To verify FFT as sample interpolator..
### Theory

There are many mwthods for interpolation of samples, i. e., linear interplation, polynoimal interpolation and sline interpolation. 
These methods suffers from large approximation error. Fast Fourier transform based interpolation is discovered by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This method estimates interpolation with the help of Fourier transform by dividing large polynomial into smaller one. 

In this experiment fast Fourier transform has been used for interpolation of samples. user will enter samples of the data samples observed from any other source within the specified criterion. He/she will be able to use fast Fourier transform for interpolation of data and the outputs being generated by those codes simultaneously.
Code to be used:
 
```MATLAB Program code
FFT Calculation: m = length(y);     # Calculating the length
            n = floor((m+1)/2);  # a delay of required time is obtained
            z = fft(y)/m;
            a0 = z(1); 
            an = 2*real(z(2:n));
            a6 = z(n+1);
            bn = -2*imag(z(2:n));

```

This MATLAB program guides to compute FFT coeffcients which are used to compute polynomial coeffcient using Gauss Model.

### Procedure
The user inputs the delay he/she wants  and sees a squarewave corresponding to that delay.If the user wants to give the frequency , then he/she must find half of the inverse of frequency.

<pre><code>DELAY = 1/(2 * FREQUENCY)
</code></pre>
